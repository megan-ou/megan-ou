Hello! 

I am a student pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration with a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in studying Operations and Technology Management with a focus on data analytics. In the coming years at UP, I hope to explore AI machine learning and to implement it in businesses and operational systems. 

My current projects include collaborating with three other Computer Science students to develop a Mahjong Game App in Android Studio. Follow the app's progress by checking out my pinned repository!

My grad plan features courses in Java programming, C programming and Data Structures, R programming, Python, and a Linux Lab.
